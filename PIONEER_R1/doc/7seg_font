reZet80 7-segment font [last modified: 2022-12-27]
--------------------------------------------------

This is the 7-segment font used by the reZet80 PIONEER 16-digit display.

The following patterns are defined in order to obtain unique, unambiguous
shapes for all alphanumericals ("0"-"9", "A"-"Z") and punctuation symbols.
Well, almost. Here are the exceptions:
"1" is identical with "I", "2" is identical with "Z" and "5" is identical
with "S" but the correct interpretation results from the context.
"K", "M" and "W" are unusual.
"O" is the lower case "o", so the upper case "O" is "0".
"V" looks like a lower case "u", so "U" is the upper case "U".
"X" looks like an upper case "H", so "H" is the lower case "h".
Please also note the slight differences between "9", "Q" and "Y".
