---------------------------------------------------------------

The Z80 uses 1.5 clock cycles for the opcode fetch during the M1 cycle and
2.5 clock cycles for all other read/write operations from/to ROM/RAM.

The maximum clock frequency for the NMOS Z80 is 2.5 MHz.
At 2.5 MHz 1 clock cycle takes 400 ns, so 1.5 clock cycles mean 600 ns and
2.5 clock cycles last for 1000 ns.

The slowest 2716 memory chip has an access time of 450 ns. Adding 80 ns for
2 LSTTL demultiplexer stages needed to decode the ROM address results in a
maximum total access time of 530 ns that is about 10% below the 600 ns
needed for the M1 cycle.
Nevertheless, if possible use faster 2716 or compatible memory chips.

Decoding the RAM address takes 120 ns, 3 demultiplexer stages.
The slowest 2114 memory chip has an access time of 450 ns.
This sums up to 570 ns, far below 1000 ns.

The current reZet80 PIONEER specs:
- CPU: Z80 clocked at 2 MHz, 500 ns clock cycle
- RAM: 2114-1 (NEC 1024x4): 300 ns access time
- ROM: MB8516 (Fujitsu 2716 compatible): 450 ns access time
- ROM: K573PF2 (Russian 2716 clone): access time unknown
