reZet80 keypad specs [last modified: 2022-01-09]
------------------------------------------------

This is the 20-key keypad for the KEYPAD bus (see specs_KEYPAD_bus).

The keys '0' to 'F' plus 4 special keys (ENTER, BACK, ESC and SHIFT) are
connected via the 74C923 chip.
This CMOS chip was not available in the 70s but it is LPTTL compatible and
simplifies the circuit because it supports key debouncing and interrupts.
In the reZet80 PIONEER it triggers /NMI once a key is pressed. I use the NMI
(non-maskable interrupt) because it has the fastest interrupt response time.

The card uses one I/O port in the 8-bit I/O space (see specs_IO_decoding).

An alternative circuit without the 74C923 can be constructed using LSTTL
chips (see specs_keypad2). But the circuit requires polling the keys.
