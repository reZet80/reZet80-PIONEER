reZet80 4 KiB ROM 2 KiB RAM card specs [last modified: 2021-06-25]
------------------------------------------------------------------

Two 2 KiB ROM chips produce an amount of 4 KiB ROM, the maximum amount of
ROM available on the card.
The minimal ROM configuration is one chip of 2 KiB.
Populate U5 for ROM from 0000 to 07FF first.
Populate U6 for ROM from 0800 to 0FFF.

Two 1024x4 SRAM chips produce an amount of 1 KiB RAM.
This is the minimal RAM configuration.
Four SRAM chips can be installed in total providing a maximum of 2 KiB RAM.
Populate U1 and U3 for RAM from 3C00 to 3FFF first.
Populate U2 and U4 for RAM from 3800 to 3BFF.

EEPROM chips can also be used although they were not available in the 70s
(just in case an easier handling is more important than a 70s feeling).
