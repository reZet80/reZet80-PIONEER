reZet80 6-digit display card specs [last modified: 2021-04-06]
--------------------------------------------------------------

This is the 6-digit display card for the DISPLAY bus (see specs_DISPLAY_bus).

It displays 6 hexadecimal numbers with 7-segment LED displays.
Please note that the decimal point (DP) is wired in hardware but not enabled
in software in the current version.
The card has been designed for 7mm common cathode LED displays.
Provisions have been made to accomodate all LED displays up to a height
of 17,78 mm (distance between pins) but you'll have to wire them yourself on
the card.
It's also possible to use common anode displays but hardware and software
need to be adapted.

The card uses one I/O port in the 8-bit I/O space (see specs_IO_decoding).
