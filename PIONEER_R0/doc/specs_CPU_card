-----------------------------------------------------

The Z80 is the heart of the system and the CPU card is quite simple.
It connects all 40 CPU pins to the bus.

The bus signals BUSACK, BUSREQ, HALT, INT, NMI, RFSH and WAIT are optional
and can be used for user-defined purposes.

Check the reZet80 CPU bus specs R2 (specs_CPU_bus).

6 resistors 4k7 are used to pull the signals BUSREQ, CLK, INT, NMI, RESET
and WAIT high.

Additionally an oscillator is available on the card.
With the help of a jumper 2 different clock speeds and 3 configurations
are possible:
- CPU card oscillator for the entire system
- An external oscillator for the entire system
- CPU card oscillator only for the CPU and an external oscillator for the
rest of the system

This card is usable for both NMOS and CMOS Z80 CPUs.

Bill of materials:
- reZet80 CPU R2 PCB
- 40-pin right-angled male connector
- DIP-40 socket (or ZIF-40 socket in order to easily exchange CPUs, optional)
- DIP-8 or DIP-14 socket (depending on oscillator size, optional)
- Z80 CPU (NMOS or CMOS)
- oscillator (DIP-8 or DIP-14)
- 6x resistor 4k7 (or 10k)
- 3x capacitor 100 nF
- 8x jumper wire (optional)
