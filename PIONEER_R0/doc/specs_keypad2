------------------------------------------------

This is the alternative 20-key keypad for the KEYPAD bus
(see specs_KEYPAD_bus).

The keys '0' to 'F' plus 4 special keys (ENTER, BACK, ESC and SHIFT) are
connected via LSTTL chips.

The card uses two I/O ports in the 8-bit I/O space (see specs_IO_decoding).
It could also be implemented to use only one I/O port but it would require
one extra demultiplexer and currently we have plenty of free I/O ports.
