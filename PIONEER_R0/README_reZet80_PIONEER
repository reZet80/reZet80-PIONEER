--------------------------------------------------

This README describes the reZet80 PIONEER system.

reZet80 stands for "Reset me back to the 80s with the Z80".

The reZet80 PIONEER is my version of a computer system that could have been
built in the late 70s.
It is built from scratch and not a copy of any other Z80 system.

It includes a mainboard with power supply sockets, on/off switch,
reset switch, memory and I/O decoding circuitry and a Z80 CPU card, a memory
card (ROM and RAM), a display, a keypad and of course the monitor software.
The system will be enhanced in the future.

The reZet80 PIONEER is a stand-alone system without a connection to a host.
All peripherals are connected directly to the Z80 and no other processor like
for example AVR, PIC or ARM will be used, neither as a bootloader nor to
attach peripherals to.

This project involves hardware and software development.
I plan to develop and build every single pcb trace and every single bit
of machine code by myself from scratch.

The Zilog Z80 was introduced in 1976 in NMOS technology.
At the same time static memory chips like the 2125 (1K x 1 bit) and the
2114 (1K x 4 bit) were already available but were very expensive so memory
was a scarce resource.
Dynamic RAM chips were more affordable back then. DRAM chips with a single
+5V power supply like Intel's 2118 were available in 1979.
UV erasable 2 KiB PROMs with a single +5V power supply like Intel's 2716
were already available by 1977.
TI's TIL311 dates from 1972.
General Instrument's AY-3-8910 Programmable Sound Generator (PSG) was
released in 1978.

In its basic configuration the reZet80 PIONEER is equipped with 1 KiB of
static RAM and 2 KiB of ROM containing a very simple debug monitor.
The maximum amount of onboard RAM and ROM are 2 KiB and 4 KiB, respectively.
The ROM can be upgraded to 14 KiB. RAM can be extended to 12 KiB and further
increased by the addition of dynamic RAM.

Input and output are implemented by a 20-key keypad and a 6-digit display
(either 7-segment LEDs or TIL311 LEDs that are more costly).

An expansion bus, a video card, a memory cartridge, a sound card based on
the AY-3-8910 chip and a joystick are planned to be added later.
Plans for the future also include to enhance the debug monitor and to provide
a text adventure, at least one arcade clone, an assembler, a disassembler,
a debugger and a C compiler.
