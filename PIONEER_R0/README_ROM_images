ROM images README [last modified: 2021-06-25]
---------------------------------------------

Many configurations are possible given the installed amount of RAM and the
alternative displays and keypads but only 2 ROM images are provided. Both
are built for the default configuration (74C923 keypad and TIL311 display)
with 1 and 2 KiB RAM, respectively. Other images can be compiled by adjusting
the hardware configuration in the file "_pioneer.asm".
ROM listings (".lst" files) are also provided.

"_ROM_1K": 1 KiB RAM, 74C923 keypad, TIL311 display
"_ROM_2K": 2 KiB RAM, 74C923 keypad, TIL311 display
