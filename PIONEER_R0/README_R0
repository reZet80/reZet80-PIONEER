--------------------------------------------------

Welcome to reZet80!
reZet80 stands for "Reset me back to the 80s with the Z80".
reZet80 features a set of retro projects to develop computing and
arcade systems that resemble the Z80 machines of the late 70s and early 80s.
All systems are built from scratch and not copies of any other Z80 system.
The development process includes hardware design and low-level software
programming in Assembler.
I started reZet80 back in 2016.

This project involves hardware and software development.
I will develop and build every single pcb trace and every single bit
of machine code by myself from scratch.

The reZet80 PIONEER is an expandable modular stand-alone computer system
that could have been built in the late 70s.
In its basic configuration the reZet80 PIONEER is equipped with a Z80 CPU
card and a memory card with 1 KiB of static RAM and 2 KiB of ROM containing
a simple debug monitor. The maximum amount of RAM and ROM of the memory card
are 2 KiB and 4 KiB, respectively. The ROM can be upgraded to 14 KiB.
RAM can be extended to 12 KiB and further increased by the addition of
dynamic RAM.
Input and output are implemented by a 20-key keypad and a 6-digit display
(either 7-segment LEDs or TIL311 LEDs that are more costly).
The mainboard also includes power supply sockets, on/off switch, reset
switch and memory and I/O decoding circuitry (8 I/O ports).
The reZet80 PIONEER is the big sister/brother of the reZet80 SCOUT.

An expansion bus, a video card, a memory cartridge, a sound card based on
the AY-3-8910 chip and a joystick are planned to be added later.
Plans for the future also include to enhance the debug monitor and to provide
a text adventure, at least one arcade clone, an assembler, a disassembler,
a debugger and a C compiler.

Components that were not available in the 70s will be used as alternatives
to add value to the system.

The Zilog Z80 was introduced in 1976 in NMOS technology.
At the same time static memory chips like the 2125 (1K x 1 bit) and the
2114 (1K x 4 bit) were already available but were very expensive so memory
was a scarce resource.
Dynamic RAM chips were more affordable back then. DRAM chips with a single
+5V power supply like Intel's 2118 were available in 1979.
UV erasable 2 KiB PROMs with a single +5V power supply like Intel's 2716
were already available by 1977.
TI's TIL311 dates from 1972.
General Instrument's AY-3-8910 Programmable Sound Generator (PSG) was
released in 1978.
